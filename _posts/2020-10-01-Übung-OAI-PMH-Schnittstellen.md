The problem I had with this exercise was the access to the server on which the DSpace demo version is hosted (since it was not available Saturday after the lecture, meaning it took motivation to do it later). Meaning also I had to re-do the steps from the lecture (building the communication, collection, and publishing the document in the collection). I won’t lie, I needed to work with the video of the last lecture, I wouldn't have been able to do it on my own. 

Another annoying thing was, that the second part of the exercise could only be concluded on the next day (which somehow I missed the information, and needed to ask my peers for help). 

The third attempt to conclude the exercise was successful. I was able to find my file in XML format. The object was to download the XML file in TXT file (conversion of the format with the OPI). At first glance, the TXT file also seemed to be accurate to the data entered the day before (it is crucial to check since information loss might occur). 

The main objective of the OPI interface is to export and import files, which allows and facilitates the interaction of different libraries.
