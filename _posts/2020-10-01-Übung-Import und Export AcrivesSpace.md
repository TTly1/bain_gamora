I had a problem and was confused about how to download the XML file from the Eadiva website. For me, it kept on opening a new tab. I had to ask my colleagues how they solved this problem. (Maybe a more specific manual would be good?).

The goal of the exercise was to understand the import and export of data into ArchivesSpace, and to compare the files (did it, surfer, any information?). Which data format suits best? And what are my acknowledgments? 

### Import
The file that I downloaded was in XML format and the import of the file was in EAD format. After the import, the display in ArchivesSapce of the import data was compared with the  HTML view of the XML data. The structure of the data in ArchivesSpace was more difficult to understand. I find the HTML view much neater. The inventory data was also missing in the ArchivesSpace interface. 
Also, after we discussed the exercise in class, I noticed that the time range is also different. 

### export
I had trouble in finding the export button, which is for the users not intuitive under the category “resource”. The export of the data needed to be in MARCXML format. I compared the MARCXML file with the data in ArchivesSpace and noticed the display on ArchivesSpace had more information (data) than the exported file. And can conclude, that when exporting a file, it would be done with caution, since information loss may occur. 
##### My takeaway, is always check your original file - when importing or exporting a file and check for information (data) loss. 

### Findings from the discussion in class: 
Interesting to see that the information loss did not happen when importing, but the EAD format already missed some information.
