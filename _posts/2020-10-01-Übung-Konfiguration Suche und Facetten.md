As homework, we needed to install VuFind (which is an open-source library search engine) and watch the training video *“Konfiguration Suche und Facetten”*. The video on YouTube gave a step-by-step tutorial on how to configure VuFind. 
Unfortunately, even with the step-by-step guide, the configuration did not work seamlessly, and I had to ask my colleagues for help. 

After the problem was solved, I was able to start with the second part of the homework. As an information science student, I think it is really important to understand how to use facets for search purposes. The facete search is optimized with the filter options (filters come in search very handy, especially in this case where the database is enormous and many different spellings are in place). I would be interested to see if first-time users without search knowledge would understand how to use this functionality, or combine search criteria. The interesting thing about the software (and the tutorial) is to see that this software offers a great amount of configurations to implement according to the user's needs.
