Something I am just realizing, write an entry in your diary as soon as possible. Unfortunately, I have forgotten a lot about the first lecture we had - meaning I had to re-watch it and it cost me twice the time. So lesson learned!  

The first lecture was to give an introduction to the BAIN shared document, and everything else we are going to work with during the semester. Since I had so many issues with my laptop during summer (due to too many installed things, which used a lot of storage space), I, unfortunately, deleted some of FH’s systems… And the VPN (Pulse Secure) was one of them. Needed to have it in order to access the BAIN files through Horizon (which was also not working).
I had to contact the FH to ask them where to find the instructions to download the Pulse Secure again. This all worked quite fast and with no fuss. 

After this, I was set, and could finally begin! I’ve tried to work with the virtual box (Linux), but also had trouble accessing and navigating through it (also kinda traumatized by the virtual machine, since we needed to work with Ubuntu before and that was a nightmare).
The browser version however is much better!! I did have trouble finding the @ symbol on my keyboard. In case someone has a mouse and a mac, let them know the mouse can be found by pressing: **option + 2.** :)


Also on the 2nd day, we had an introduction to the [Unix Shell](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-what-is-shell.htm) (which luckily I already was familiar with) and added a few commands in it to see what happens. Since I am still very lost (on where to find what, and what and WHY we need to open and operate), I felt that the lecture had a very fast pace. And I had difficulty understanding _what we are doing, why we are doing it, and where we are doing it_. I hope I will pick up as soon as I am settled and it becomes a routine. 

What I have discovered about Unix Shell is: like the terminal on MacBooks. It is the command lines (also the interface to the Unix system). By entering commands in the shell (it is a command language but also a scripting language) you can control but also execute systems. Meaning you enter (input) and it generates the output.  

Furthermore, I surfed a bit on the web to find more materials and command lines (which helped me a lot for the overall understanding). But I still think, it would be helpful if we always could discuss the WHY in class (why do we need to enter these command lines - why not simply download and install something, as I usually do on my personal computer? etc.). Last but not least, I think more hands-on examples, will surly answer and also raise many questions. But at least, we can work go through the exercise / example together. 

Setting up the diary on GitHub was easy (however, since I do not always read the instructions clearly before starting, I faced some barriers). For example, the SETTING isn’t the same as **my personal settings** and therefore I couldn’t find the page to generate my URL GitHub page. Kind of drove me crazy. To make it “foolproof” maybe next time set step-by-step pictures instructions?
