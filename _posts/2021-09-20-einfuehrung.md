Wo bin ich gestartet?

Right at the very beginning I guess… With almost z-e-r-o experience. And if I must be completely frank, my interest level is also very low. Therefore, I hope to be positively surprised on what to come. Experience with library or archiving software I have as a user. Library, the service which is provided by the FHGR to conduct research, downloads etc.. As for archiving I personally use google drive, and iCloud for my private data. And at work I am forced to use Alresco and feds.ed.admin.ch for the governmental project I work on. But I wouldn’t know if these count as archiving software. More experience with library or archiving content I have from my past semester, which to be 100% honest, did not interest me very much. Pursuing a career and studying part-time, I have to set clear goals and balance my time to piories. 

Furthermore, I believe having a ground knowledge on how to efficiently archive your data/files will be a great advantage for the future. At the end of the course, I would hope to gain new learning, which I could implement in my daily life (professionally and privately). Hope not aiming totally in the wrong direction.
