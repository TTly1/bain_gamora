In this lecture, I got to dive into the collaborative work of libraries and how they create a platform that has its aim to hold all scientific information in one. And also, on how a specific international library software functions. Two guest lectures gave us an insight into the tools they daily work with - Alma. Ms. Charlotte Frauchiger and Ms. Selina Hodel are both from the FHNW eRessourcen department. 

## SLSP (Swiss Library Service Platform)
A swiss wide platform, which has its goal to bring together all scientific information in Switzerland creating the swisscovery. The swisscovery consists of 475 libraries and holds more than 50 Million media. With swisscovery, the SLSP is innovating and digitizing the development of libraries and information gathering. Making it easier for scientific progress and new discoveries. [1]

## ALMA
Alma is an end-to-end library software, unifying different library services in one single platform, and is used worldwide by different libraries. Alma’s service platform is used for managing the acquisition, sharing, cataloging, and use of all kinds of resources, including physical and e-books, or and other digital resources (such as audio, image, and video files), etc. Alma is managed by Ex Libris, which is constantly improving and releasing new features (as I understood). Alma is cloud-based and web-based.[2]

## ALAM usability: 

As I never  worked with Alma (and probably will never again will again), I have quickly scanned its UX design and come up with the following: 

The design is new, however not very modern (in my opinion, even if they attempted with the icons) 
The navigation is not very clear - the header is filled with options as so is the navigation on the side (no clear cut between first and secondary navigation)
Usage of icons is cool (can facilitate usability)  
The metadata view and editing functionality is very clean and gives a great overview and I imagine it is easy to use
→ Overall I would say, it is a tool that requires a longer adaptation phase (especially for people who are not very techy, since the platform offers many services), but the filtering helps with the navigation and search for features/functions. It holds room for improvement but isn’t the worst from what I have seen at first glance. 

The second part of the lecture was dedicated to archiving standards/guidelines and achieving software. 

## ISAD(G)
Stands for General International Standard Archival Description (second edition), which defines a list of elements and rules on how to archive properly. From what I understand, it has a hierarchy of descriptions that also determines, which information should include where. [3] There are 26 elements of description, and only 6 elements are required. 

There are however flaws also in the ISAD(G) - for example, 

Because it was developed in the 90s and revised in 2000 (meaning 21 years ago), they are a few limits, the three limits which were presented during the lecture:
there might be data, which can also be understood in a context. The tectonics is only one-dimensional. No multiple allocations are possible, and last, the ISAD(G) does not provide any specification on how to digitalize or for long-term archiving. 

## ArchivesSpace Usability
The usability for a new joiner is very overwhelming. Many input fields and options (a bit of an overload). Maybe it would be better to create a clear process with a progress bar? Most of the fields are not required input fields, so it would maybe be best to hide them completely? Also, it would be interesting to know, if a user can save a view, and have it as default with only the field he/she uses?
