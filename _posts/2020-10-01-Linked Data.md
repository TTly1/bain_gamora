And everything comes to an end. Today, we had our last BAIN class and looking back, this module had some positive surprises. 

The goal of the 9th and final class was to understand and get a brief market overview of the discovery systems (which was briefly stated in my last entry). 

Before getting into the practical example, we talked about horizontal and vertical search. Since these different search engines caught my attention, I did deeper research on what they are, and who applies these methods [1]. 

#### Vertical Search:
A topical search searches in a specific part of the internet (or catalogue). It is very specific, where the outcome is also a specific media type or content. 
→ searching in different sections of google (news, image, etc.) 

#### Horizontal Search: 
Is a generic search, where the whole internet (catalogue) is searched. It searches a wider range of media topics and media subjects. 
→ entering a search query in the search bar 


### Practical examples

I very much appreciated the small insight into the “real world” we got in this lecture. It made all lectures and know-how more tangible. We were introduced to the “Deutsche Literatur Archiv Marbach” (DLA). According to Wikipedia, it is one of the most significant literary archives in the world! Preserving valuable collections from literary and intellectual history from 1750 to the present day. [2] Since 2017, DLA is also working with an open-source company (Webwork) on the new catalogue [3]. 
If I understood correctly our lecturer worked on the development of the new catalogue, which has the TYPO3 discovery - system. The aim of this new catalogue was to make it possible for content to be searched across the “board” (horizontal search). This facilitates the search for users who don't know “where” to look for a specific element. 

The demonstration of the new catalogue (which can be also accessed with the link: https://www.dla-marbach.de/katalog-beta) was very interesting to see. The website’s UI gives a very modern and fresh feeling. Also, the icons facilitate the understanding for the user, making it also modern. Another usability positive feature is the search suggestion, which the user gets when typing in the search bar. I must say that this was by far, the best UI / UX I saw from all the software and systems we have seen. 

## Linked Data

We covered linked data in the semantic classes, so the term is not unfamiliar. However, I was curious to see the usage of linked data in BAIN. First, we got an introduction to the “Bibliographic Framework Initiative'' (BIBFRAME). Googling the web, to understand the link between BIBFRAME and linked data I found this sentence which gives a good summary: //“Within this entity-relation model, BIBFRAME is further modelled within RDF/XML in order to bring the model in-line with Semantic Web principles.”// [4]. BIBIFRAME was developed to replace MARC21, since it can no longer meet the demands the digital network has today. In my words I would say: the BIBFRAME will link all data from e.g. a book, making it more efficient to manage (if and when a change of let’s say a title is required). 

The second system we looked at was the Records in Context (RiC) which is currently being developed (and which I had much more difficulty understanding). From what I understand, RiC is a conceptual model which has the aim to bring the different standards together (ISAD(G), ISAAR(CPF), and so on) to facilitate the management of electronic records. This can be done by using as seen in BIBIFRAME with the linked-data principle. Bringing also here, an advantage to managing the data.
