### Archive system vs. Library System
It was also discussed the differences between the archive system vs. library system. 

Here are the main differences: 
Library: Library system record media, which are mostly published material, and primarily for usages. The materials are organized according to the subject classification. Library systems use the metadata format MARC 21 (which will also be replaced by BIBFRAME). 

Archive: Archive system records unique items and primary source material directly from the source. The items are mostly not published materials (and items can contain restricted information).  They are recorded by the EDA guidelines, and soon to be replaced by the Records in Content (RIC).  

### Repository-Software for publications and research data

#### Repository: 
In the digital age, a repository is like an archive, where digital objects are stored, and managed. They are usually open for the public (or to a specific group which are connected to the specific content). 

#### Publications: 
Publications make scientific information publically available, and allow the rest of the academic audience to evaluate the quality of the research. There are various types of publications like Scholarly Journals, Professional or Trade Publications, Popular and General Interest Magazines. [2]

#### Research Data:
Not only the publication but also the primary data (raw data), which is defined as research data can be found in Respository software. According to the website forschungsdaten.info, there are different types of research data, and it depends on the project and academic disciplines. The different data, also require different methods to be processed and managaged.[2]

According to the OpenDOAR statistics, the country with the most repositories is the US, and the most used software platform is DSpace (39%). And most content format (publication) to be found journal articles. 


DSpace:
Is an open digital repositories, for publications. The benefit of dSpace is, that it is free, “easy to use”, and can be costumize by users needs. New metadata: qualified Dublin core (according to Mr. Meyer - easier than MARK 21 and EDA).
DSpace is rather new (2016), and has already a new version DSpace 7.x., which came out on August 2 - but does not have all functionality of the DSpace 6.x.
