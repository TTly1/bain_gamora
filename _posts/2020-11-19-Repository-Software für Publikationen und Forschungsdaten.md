###Archive system vs. Library System
It was also discussed the differences between the archive system vs. library system. 

Here are the main differences: 
Library: Library system record media, which are mostly published material, and primarily for usages. The materials are organized according to the subject classification. Library systems use the metadata format MARC 21 (which will also be replaced by BIBFRAME). 

Archive: Archive system records unique items and primary source material directly from the source. The items are mostly not published materials (and items can contain restricted information).  They are recorded by the EDA guidelines, and soon to be replaced by the Records in Content (RIC).  

### Repository-Software for publications and research data

#### Repository: 
In the digital age, a repository is like an archive, where digital objects are stored, and managed. They are usually open to the public (or to a specific group that is connected to the specific content). 

#### Publications: 
Publications make scientific information publically available, and allow the rest of the academic audience to evaluate the quality of the research. There are various types of publications like Scholarly Journals, Professional or Trade Publications, Popular, and General Interest Magazines. [1]

#### Research Data:
Not only the publication but also the primary data (raw data), which is defined as research data can be found in Repository software. According to the website forschungsdaten.info, there are different types of research data, and it depends on the project and academic disciplines. The different data, also require different methods to be processed and managed.[2]

According to the OpenDOAR statistics, the country with the most repositories is the US, and the most used software platform is DSpace (39%). And most content format (publication) to be found journal articles. 

### DSpace:
Is an open digital repository, for publications. The benefit of dSpace is, that it is free, “easy to use”, and can be customized by users’ needs. New metadata: qualified Dublin core (according to Mr. Meyer - easier than MARK 21 and EDA).
DSpace is rather new (2016), and has already a new version DSpace 7.x., which came out on August 2 - but does not have all functionality of the DSpace 6.x just yet. 

The good thing about DSpace is that no installation was needed. We used the online demo version for all the exercises. 

In class, we created together sub-community with a collection. As a second step, we added a recourse to the collection. The design of the DSpace is in contrast to other systems we already interacted with, modern - but also here I found the usability rather complicated. For example, there is more than one workflow to add a recourse to the collection (and I don’t find it very intuitive). But I found it good, that there are many options for individualization which users can set according to their needs.
