If last week was emoji with a head explosion, this week was with a double explosion! I was one of the unfortunate, who couldn’t log in into Koha - meaning, I needed support. I am super grateful to Sebastian for taking his time to assist and support me. It was also cool to see that by having my “personal number” he was able to do it for me from his terminal… so that was interesting. Nevertheless, very very frustrating. I assume it was frustrating for everyone. 

Additionally, I think the class has an overall problem with understanding the “purpose”. Since few are “experts'' and already very familiar with the software, processes, etc., others are a bit lost, and don’t understand the WHY of it. I personally, don’t understand why I would need to know how the library or archiving software works. Koha, for example - I found it too specific and I couldn’t see any synergies I could build for any other subjects. And on the other hand, we never dive fully in, meaning that to understand it 100% would also not be enough. So my motivation is a bit low at the moment. I really don’t understand the reasoning for why I am doing it all that. I understand that in life you sometimes (or even often) you’re confronted with subjects/tasks you are not very fond of… but being in the 7th semester, having my major - and still having subjects that do not really relate to usability or design, is a bit annoying (I hope to not have offended someone because this is not my intention). In the end, I guess it is what it is - but maybe it will change for the upcoming classes…

Also in this class, we recorded a book in Koha, created a user, and also walked through the scenario when a book is lent. I was happy that this example was made in class. Since I don’t have any knowledge of this subject. Also, due to the bad usability (check next section). 

We also checked two other functionalities in Koha, SRU, and OAI-PMH. 

SRU: is a Search/Retrieval via URL. As I understood it allows you to search a catalog and retrieve results. 
OAI: stands for Open Archives Initiative-Protocol for Metadata Harvesting. In Koha, it is a Data Provider, which allows providing free access to metadata. Also, in class, we used this for the data import. 

## Koha Usability:

Some usability/design elements I could observe during my interaction with Koha - it is horrible. The design reminds me of an old windows design, and the usability - well, I guess people are used to it (or they get used to it). 

#### Usability flaws:

Good implementation: the icons - Icons usually help with the speed of perception and support the information. The different widgets gave a modern and minimalist look, which also helped with the usability of the product. 

Before the class ended we were given the task to install the next system for the next class. 

## ArchivSpace 
The installation of ArchivSpace was not that “easy”. I somehow didn’t understand that the installation was concluded since the lines on the terminal didn’t stop coming - and waited more than an hour… Then I re-read the guidelines (before sending an email), and I had my “AHA-moment”. Luckily the installation worked, and I hope it will not be a “mess” like last time.   

ArchivesSpace (more in the US) - not very used in Switzerland (here we use scopeArchiv) 
ArchivesSpace is an open-source system, which also is easy and free to download, and the main reason why we used it.  It had the objective to showcase the structure of the system and how it is used (to get a feeling of what metadata is needed etc.).

ArchivesSpace is an open-source web application for managing archives information. It functions under the standards DACS, ISAD(G), and  ISAAR(CPF). The application also enables and generates different data formats (EAD, MARCXML und METS).
